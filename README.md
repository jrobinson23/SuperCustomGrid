SuperCustomGrid
===============

This is a modified Rally Custom Grid app using Rally's AppSDK 2.0RC3. It includes pagination as a first pass, which is a huge win seeing as how the default Custom Grid was limited to 200 results. Please feel free to hack at and modify as needed to meet your own needs.

Big Thanks to bearhart-rally, who coded with me from square 1 as a pairing project and helped to ensure that this got completed and tested, and krmorse for their time and help!
